# Docker-CI

Docker-CI is a [docker](https://docker.io) image, based in Debian Wheezy, for a Continuous Integration environment.

## What is shipped with it?

+ Oracle Java 7 (Read [this](https://forums.docker.com/t/dockerfile-java-oracle-java7-repo-not-found-issue/1472/2)!)
+ Maven 3
+ MongoDB 2.6
+ Solr 4.10

## Can I use it?

Of course. It probably does not suit your use-case, but you can use it as a start for your own Dockerfile.

## Why it's not in Docker Hub?

Because of [this](https://forums.docker.com/t/dockerfile-java-oracle-java7-repo-not-found-issue/1472/2).
